# TheActionAdventurePlatformer
This project was created by me, Alex_Requiemd,
with the intention of facilitating the creation of a platform and adventure game
based on the metroidvania genre with it being the basis for my future game and 
also for other people to use in their projects.

All sound assets like background music and sound effects are not made by me 
and are just placeholders.
The graphical assets are also largely unoriginal, so they are also placeholders
for just a better understanding of the project's mechanics.

If you are going to use the project, I recommend removing these assets completely
to avoid any problems with the copyright holders.

Besides the graphic and sound assets, you are free to use this for 
personal and commercial projects. You don't have to credit me, but I'd appreciate it
if you do, I'd like to know if anyone else will enjoy it.


Thank you for read me, you're a nice person (>°u°)=b
